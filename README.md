#Plagiarism Detector
A web based Plagiarism detection system which takes in a corpus of documents and a potentially plagiarised documentby and outputs the set of documents from which the document was plagiarized from. Various algorithms we are using for the system are:

1. Longest Common Sub-sequence
2. Naive String Search
3. Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)
4. Boyer-Moore Algorithm

Input

1. A bunch of existing documents
2. Single file which has to be evaluated for plagiarism

Output

1. Set of documents from which the plagiarised document was copied from
2. Copied sentences in the plagiarised document
